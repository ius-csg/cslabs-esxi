# cslabs-esxi

## Introduction

A lightweight webserver to serve as a simplified esxi api for the needs of the project.
The web services api could only be consumed from .net or java but unfortunately there is
no documentation for .net core. Therefor communication with the ESXI host will happen 
through this lightweight api.
